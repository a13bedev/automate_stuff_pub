1)  pyCharm console do not
    import modules (myCats.py) even if cwd is
    'C:\\Users\\1\\PycharmProjects\\automate_stuff\\Chapter_8'
    and module is contained in cwd

    Solve: in project explorer right-click on needed directory.
    Then select "Mark Directory as" and select "Source Root".
    Unmark in the same fashion.


2)  method to run scripts with batch file does not work.
