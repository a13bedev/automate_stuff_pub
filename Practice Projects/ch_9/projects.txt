"Filling in the Gap" project is interesting problem
i haven't wrapped my mind around it yet
it is possible to use lexicographical order to sort file names
- but how to measure a gap between them and increment lowest possible?
   - what is lowest possible sign is another question?

file_names = ['spam001', 'spam0001', 'spam01']
the lowest is 'spam0001' (i.e. file_names[1])

so the other files should be renamed such as:
'spam001' or 'spam01' in 'spam0002' etc.

or if and only if files have number part in it
like ['spam001','spam027','spam0013', 'spam013']
should length of number part be the same?
there is 4 files and gap (max-min) is 027 - 001 == 26
so what file to rename first
should it look like ['spam001', 'spam002','spam003','spam004']?
